            <p>This is my first website I am currently working on using html and css. <br> I will add new things over time, but remember I am new to this, <br> so it will take time.  <br> Thanks and enjoy.</p>

                Oh and by the way here is the weather for today, <br>even though you could just walk outside <br>and find out the weather by yourself.  <br>But no one does that sort of thing these days. <br>Forgot to mention this is for Salt Lake City, Utah.  <br> If you are looking for weather in a different city, <br>there are plenty of ways to find out what it is.
