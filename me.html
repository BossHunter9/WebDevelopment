                Hello nice to meet you.<br>Here is a little bit on who I am.

                <p>
                    <br>I am currently a teenage living in Utah.  <br>I have only lived in two different states, <br>but I have lived in three different houses.
                    <br>I have also only left the country once.  <br> And that was only when I went to the canadian <br>side of Niagra Falls.
